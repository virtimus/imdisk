  ''' <summary>
  ''' <para>Interface with functionality required for a class to represent an object that can
  ''' service ImDisk/Devio I/O requests at server side. Classes implementing this
  ''' interface provides functions for determining properties such as virtual disk size
  ''' and whether virtual disk is writable, as well as functions for reading from and
  ''' optionally writing to virtual disk.</para>
  ''' 
  ''' <para>To make implementation easier, two base classes implement this interface. That is
  ''' DevioProviderManagedBase and DevioProviderUnmanagedBase. The first one makes it
  ''' possible to implement this interface by just overriding a few functions for reading
  ''' data to and writing data from managed byte arrays. The latter one makes it possible
  ''' to implement this interface by just overriding a few functions for reading data to
  ''' and writing data from unmanaged memory provided a pointer to unmanaged block of
  ''' memory.</para>
